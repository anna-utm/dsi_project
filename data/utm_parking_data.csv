https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/parking/license-plate-recognition-lpr,License Plate Recognition (LPR),"License Plate Recognition (LPR) License Plate Recognition We use License Plate Recognition (LPR) on campus! LPR is an advanced parking technology that uses a vehicle's license plate as a permit instead of paper permits or hangtags. It is no longer be necessary to display cash receipts or permits in vehicles parked on the UTM campus. Multiple vehicles may be registered to your permit, however only one vehicle can be parked on campus at any given time. If a single permit is being shared by multiple users and more than 1 vehicle needs to be parked on campus at the same time, the additional vehicle(s) are required to register and purchase their own paid parking. A permit is valid for one (1) single vehicle to be parked on campus at any given time. Frequently Asked Questions How does it work? Paid parking and enforcement are in effect at all times on the UTM campus What if I drive multiple vehicles or share my permit with someone else? How do I update my license plate information or add a new vehicle? You can update your vehicle/license plate information at any time by logging into your account. Click here for more details . What information does the University of Toronto collect about your vehicle? The LPR system employed by the University of Toronto is a third-party system that captures a photo of the license plate of each vehicle parked in a University of Toronto Mississauga parking lot, streets on campus, or managed parking areas. An alphanumeric version of the license plate number is then generated and used to link the vehicle to paid parking in the University's Permit Management system. The LPR system also captures the location of the vehicle, as well as the time and date. The photos taken by the LPR system are not of a resolution that would allow for the identification of vehicle occupants if present at the time the photo is taken. Under what authority does the University of Toronto collect this information? All vehicles parked on the UTM campus are subject to the Parking Rules & Regulations authorized by the Principal of University of Toronto Mississauga, acting on the advice of the University of Toronto Mississauga Campus Council within the power granted by the University of Toronto Act 1971, through the Governing Council. By purchasing a parking permit, applicants agree to provide the information necessary for the proper administration of the University's parking facilities, including license plate information. For additional information on the University's governance structure, please visit: governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/governance-bodies/utm-campus-council For what purposes does the University of Toronto use your information? Your personal information will not be used for employee monitoring or any other purpose. Who do we share your information with? All personal information is collected, transferred, accessed, encrypted and protected by the University through technical and process protections. We share your information internally only as necessary for the purposes outlined above. Access to records created and maintained in connection with the LPR system is restricted to trained, authorized personnel performing their duties and, when necessary, a limited number of personnel with safety, security, or legal compliance roles and responsibilities. Personal information may be shared with third-party vendors (such as information technology and LPR solutions providers) for storage and other processing of personal information. Personal information will not be sold or licensed to any third parties for secondary commercial purposes. How long do we keep your information for? All information collected through the LPR and Permit Management systems is stored, retained, and disposed of in compliance with the University's Records Management practices. parking.utm@utoronto.ca Alumni House, Room 108 Making experiences, exceptional"
https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/parking/parking-campus/parking-campus-faqs,FAQ,"Parking on Campus FAQs Frequently Asked Questions Is there anywhere on campus I can park for free? No, there is nowhere on campus that you can park for free. Parking must be paid for at all times. Is it true that I can park in any parking lot after 5:00 p.m. as long as I have a valid parking permit? Yes, all UTM parking permits are valid in all UTM parking lots after 5:00 p.m. from Monday to Friday and all day on Saturdays, Sundays and Statutory Holidays (with the exception of signed reserved spaces, car pool areas, resident parking - P6, P7 & P10 and the short term parking spaces on Inner Circle Road). I am a student who is only enrolled in evening classes. Is there a specific permit I can purchase that will allow me to park at night? Yes, you can purchase a monthly Evening parking permit. This permit is valid from 3:30 p.m. onward Monday-Thursday, and all day Friday/Saturday/Sunday & Holidays. It is valid in P4, P8 & P9. However, after 5:00 p.m. on weekdays and all day on weekends, permit holders may park in P1, P4, P5, P8, P9 and the CCT Garage as long as their permit is clearly displayed in the vehicle (with the exception of signed reserved spaces, car pool areas, resident parking - P6, P7 & P10 and the short term parking spaces on Inner Circle Road). If I have two or more cars, or need to make a change to my parking permit what can I do? You can register multiple vehicles (including rideshare/rental vehicles) to your parking permit, however only one (1) vehicle can be parked on campus at any given time. You can add/update license plates registered to your parking permit at any time by logging into your account here. If I have a valid UTM parking permit, can I also park at St. George or UTSC? If you have a valid UTM parking permit, you are only permitted to park in the designated lots at UTM. To inquire about parking for any other U of T campus, you must contact the Parking Office specific to that campus. I paid for parking at the Pay & Display machine but nothing printed. What should I do? Was I double-charged? If you attempted to pay for parking using a Pay machine and no slip printed, you were likely not charged. The machines operate by live authorizations and a ticket will only print if your transaction was approved. You are required to go through the steps again until the machine prints a slip. Failure to display a P&D slip for any reason (failed transaction, out of order machine, declined credit card, etc.) will result in a Parking Infraction Notice (parking ticket), issued by the City of Mississauga. Why can't I pay for parking at the Pay & Display machines in P1 and P5 on weekdays? On weekdays until 5:00 p.m., P1 & P5 are reserved for permit holders only. After 5:00 p.m. on weekdays and all day on weekends, patrons may purchase parking from the Pay & Display machines located in those lots. I only have to go into the William G. Davis Building for a few minutes. Is there somewhere close by I can park? Yes, you can pay for parking for up to 90 minutes (enforced maximum) in the short-term parking area located outside the William G. Davis Building. Do faculty and staff pay for parking? Yes, all faculty and staff pay for parking and they pay the same rates as students. How are parking fees set? Fees are set to cover the total costs of providing and maintaining parking facilities, smoothed over a reasonable number of years. This approach reduces the need to increase fees by large amounts in any given year (as had to be done several years ago when the underground CCT garage was built). Rather, fees are set to cover the costs over a reasonable timeframe, depending on the nature of the various costs involved. For example, the operation is currently paying back money borrowed to build the extension to the deck in lot P8 which was completed in 2016. How do I cancel my parking permit? Permits may be cancelled according to the cancellation schedule (Cancellations & Refunds) Cancellation requests must be received through the Parking Permit Portal. Many students are under severe financial pressure and cannot afford UTM parking rates. How is this issue of affordability/accessibility being addressed? Parking is one of many costs that a student may incur related to education. Anyone who is struggling financially should contact Financial Aid in the Office of the Registrar. Financial Aid is approached on a holistic basis, taking into account the financial situation of each particular student. Financial Aid Advisors will meet with a student and provide options after reviewing a student's entire financial situation, not just one aspect of it. Financial Aid offers walk-in advising, and can assist a student in reviewing their budget and identifying cost-effective strategies for managing their educational expenses. For example, in some cases Advisors may suggest alternative transportation methods which are readily available - such as taking advantage of the ‘U-pass' program, which allows UTM students unlimited fare-free rides on MiWay, Mississauga Transit's bus system. As well, the shuttle bus service that runs between the UTM and the St. George campus is free of charge for UTM students and is a cost-effective alternative for students who are taking courses at St. George and/or travel to downtown Toronto on a regular basis. Finally, sessional permits are available which allow students to purchase parking for individual sessions as compared to the 12 month annual pass, providing a more affordable option.
